## Basic Details

### Project Description
A sarcastic, never-ending progress bar website with a pastel animated background and warm ripple click effects.  
Built to frustrate, amuse, and distract users while they "wait" for something that will never load. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Testing the patience level of the user.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôve built a fake loading screen that:
Goes up, down, sideways, but never actually finishes.
Roasts you with sarcastic comments like "Almost there‚Ä¶ nope".
Distracts you with pretty warm-colored ripples wherever you click.
